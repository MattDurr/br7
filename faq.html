            <h3>How Does Battle Royale Work?</h3>
                <p>At Battle Royale, if you wish to participate in LAN games you must bring your own PC/laptop. By buying a ticket you will be given desk space, power and a network to play on for those PC Games. For console games there will be consoles set up to play on. We do have a collection of consoles however if you would like to volunteer your console for the day it would help increase the amount of games we could run.
