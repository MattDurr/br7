                    <p>Battle Royale VII is Otawa's biggest LAN party involving various computer games and gaming console tournaments. The competition last for a full				25-hours. The goal of Battle Royale is to bring together future engineers, computer scientists across the Ottawa Region to share their gaming passion in a relaxed environment. Hosted on the beautiful campus of Carleton University, this event has become an annual tradition for the university students in Ottawa studying not just Engineering and Computer Science, but other disciplines as well. Battle Royale offers a unique opportunity to companies to expose themselves to over a hundred engineering and computer science students from both the University of Ottawa, Carleton University and also Algonquin College. It has been a huge success over the past years, and this year we expect it to be even bigger and better. Battle Royale VII is going to be the best yet with an increased capacity and tournament quantity! We are also donating a protion of the profit made to the charity Child's Play, a game industry charity dedicated to improving the lives of children with toys and games worldwide.       </p>

                      <p>At Battle Royale, if you wish to participate in LAN games you must bring your own PC/laptop. By buying a ticket you will be given desk space, power and a network to play on for those PC Games. For console games there will be consoles set up to play on. We do have a collection of consoles however if you would like to volunteer your console for the day it would help increase the amount of games we could run.
