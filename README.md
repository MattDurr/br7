Battle Royale Seven Website
===

The website for Battle Royale Seven. Live now at [www.battleroyale.ca](http://www.battleroyale.ca/).

The site uses jquery for an "include" system. You'll need to run an http server to see the site properly. Python has a quick way of setting this up.

1. Install [Python](http://www.python.org/download/). Make sure it's in your PATH. On the windows installer there's an option that should be selected for it to be in your PATH.
2. Open a terminal (or git bash) and navigate to the br7/ folder
3. Run the command `python -m http.server`. This will start a server and will serve the files in the br7/ folder.
4. Visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser. You should see the site
